vFeed & vFeed API
=================

The open source cross-linked local vulnerability database

vFeed is an open source naming scheme concept that provides extra structured detailed 3rd parties references for a CVE entry. 
While the emergence of the Open Standards helped undeniably to shape a new way to communicate about vulnerabilities1, the new vFeed is adding an intelligent structured xml feed that provides effective level of information (meta-data) related to vulnerability.


Internally, vFeedCore (not published yet) collects the basis xml feeds which are generated by reliable references and correlates it across multiple information sources. Here are examples of 3rd parties sources (just to name a few):

* Security standards

  - CVE (http://cve.mitre.org)
  - CWE (http://cwe.mitre.org)
  - CPE (http://cpe.mitre.org) 
  - OVAL (http://oval.mitre.org) 
  - CAPEC (http://capec.mitre.org) 
  - CVSS (http://www.first.org/cvss) 

* Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation IDs (Metasploit, Saint Corporation, Nessus Scripts, ZDI, Exploit-DB, milw0rm)
* Vendors Security Alerts

  - Microsoft MS
  - Mandriva
  - Redhat
  - Cisco
  - Sun
  - Gentoo
  - Apple
  - ...


Key features
=================

* Built using open source technologies
* Fully downloadable SQLite local vulnerability database 
* Structured new XML format to describe vulnerabilities
* Based on major open standards CVE, CPE, CWE, CVSS..
* Support correlation with 3rd party security references (CVSS, OSVDB, OVAL…)
* Extended to support correlation with security assessment and patch vendors (Nessus, Exploit-DB, Redhat, Microsoft..)
* Simple & ready to use Python module with more than 15 methods

Target Audience
=================

* Penetration testers who want to analyze CVEs and gather extra information to help shape avenues to exploit vulnerabilities.
* Security auditors who want to report accurate information about findings. vFeed could be the best way to describe a CVE with attributes based on standards and 3rd party references as vendors or companies involved into standarization efforts.
* Security tools vendors / security open source developers who need to implement libraries to enumerate useful information about CVEs without wasting time to correlate and to create a proprietary database. vFeed is by far the best solution. Methods can be invoked from programs or scripts with a simple call.
* Any security hacker who is conducting researches and need a very fast and accurate way to enumerate available exploits or techniques to check a vulnerability


Changelog
=========

Beta v0.4.5
----------

* Added the support to CWE v2.5. Now, vFeed reports the newest CWE-id added to version 2.5. See here for more information http://cwe.mitre.org/data/reports/diff_reports/v2.4_v2.5.html
* Added the support to OWASP Top 2013. The method get_category() reports the appropriate OWASP ID. The method get_risk() also reports the categories of the attack as topAlert value.
* Better support of Microsoft Bulletins and KB.
* Extended the functions get_ms() and get_mskb() to report the Microsoft Title and URL.
* Added the support to Snort SID. A new function get_snort() is available. It returns snort sid, signature name and class type.
* Updated the vFeed XML export() function with a new attribute <defense>. The Snort IDs  could be leveraged to deploy detection capabilities.
* Fixed bug#24 https://github.com/toolswatch/vFeed/issues/24
* Fixed a bug with PCIstatus in get_risk(). Now PCIstatus is set as "Failed" when a topAlert is found
* Fixed a bug in get_risk(). The value are not set when the CVSS base is undefined
* Updated slightly get_risk() to also display CVSS scores. Top Vulnerability attribute took a sense. When all CVSS scores are set to 10, then Top Vulnerability is True.



Beta v0.4.0
-----------

* Refactored the `exportXML` method as a separate class vFeedXML (vfeed\exportxml.py). The method `export()` could be invoked to generate the appropriate vFeed XML format
* Changed methods name to something "pythonic compliant names" according to Andres Riancho (Thanks to David Mirza for python documentation). Format is now get_cve, get_cpe etc instead of the awful checkCVE, checkCPE ...(Issue Ref: https://github.com/toolswatch/vFeed/issues/13)
* Added the support to DISA/IAVM database (Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert) advisories from DoD-CERT. When available, the IAVM id and DISA VMSkey are reported
* Added the support to CERT-VN (CERT Vulnerability Notes Database (VU)). When available, the CERT-VU and Link are reported.
* Added the support to SCIP database effort from folks at www.scip.ch. The ids and link are reported (thanks to Marc Ruef @mruef for the help) 
* Added the support to OpenVAS (www.openvas.org). Whenever a reference exists, the ID, script file(s), family(s) and title are reported
* Added the support to Cisco Security Advisories (http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x)
* Added the support to Ubuntu USN Security Notices (http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/)
* Added the support to Gentoo GLSA http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/
* Added the support to Fedora Security advisories (http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/)
* To reflect the newest cross references, the following new methods have been added
 - `get_iavm` to check for DISA/IAVM ids associated with a CVE
 - `get_scip` to check for SCIP database ids
 - `get_certvn` to enumerate the CERT-VN ids
 - `get_openvas` to list the OpenVAS Vulnerability scanner scripts. It always classy to have both Nessus and OpenVAS scripts ;)
 - `get_cisco` to list cisco patchs
 - `get_ubuntu` to list ubuntu patchs
 - `get_gento`. You bet, it's for listing the Gentoo patchs
 - `get_fedora` to list the fedora patchs

* Despite the fact the OSVDB ids was already mapped with vFeed since the beginning, a new method `get_osvdb` has been added to enumerate them when available.
* Added `get_milw0rm` method even if the website is deprecated (for old time's sake)
* Introduced `vfeedcli.py` instead of awful script name `vFeed_Calls_1.py`. From now on,  vFeed CLI should  be used to get CVE attributes
* Slightly modified the `get_cve` keys to (summary, published and modified). Check the `vfeedcli.py` code source.
* vFeed XML format slightly modified. It's still easy to read and to parse.
* Minor bug fixed (when a CVE is missed, vFeed exits)
* vfeed.db regenerated to support the newest changes
* Documentation should be updated the reflect the major methods name changes


Beta v0.3.9
-----------

* Added the support of Metasploit Ids. Now vFeed reports msf exploit id, link to file and title
* Added the support of CAPEC. When the reference exists, the CAPEC id and link are reported accordingly with its associated CWE
* checkCWE extended to support the CWE title. Sometimes, it's comfortable to deal with human words than ids ;)
* checkRISK extended to support Top Categories as CWE/SANS 2011, OWASP 2010 etc. Whenever the CVE is flagged in the some specific categories (see api.py at _isTopAlert), 
the topAlert value is filled with categories name such as OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A1 - Injection or 2011 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between Components
* checkCVSS extended to support the CVSS Vector. 
* To reflect the newest cross references, 3 new methods have been added
  - checkMSF to check for Metasploit sploits or plugins
  - checkCAPEC to enumerate the CWE associated (and indirectly CVE) CAPEC ids
  - checkCATEGORY to list the whole Top Categories associated with CWE and indirectly CVE. This method is useful if topAlert doesnt report any known Top List.
  - Updated checkRISK, checkCWE and checkCVSS
  - updated exportXML to reflect the changes.
* vfeed.db regenerated from scratch to support the newest changes. 
* Documentation as usual in progress.
