* Better support of Microsoft Bulletins and KB.

Beta v0.4.0
-----------
* Refactored the `exportXML` method as a separate class vFeedXML (vfeed\exportxml.py). The method `export()` could be invoked to generate the appropriate vFeed XML format
* Changed methods name to something "pythonic compliant names" according to Andres Riancho (Thanks to David Mirza for python documentation). Format is now get_cve, get_cpe etc instead of the awful checkCVE, checkCPE ...(Issue Ref: https://github.com/toolswatch/vFeed/issues/13)
* Added the support to DISA/IAVM database (Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert) advisories from DoD-CERT. When available, the IAVM id and DISA VMSkey are reported
* Added the support to CERT-VN (CERT Vulnerability Notes Database (VU)). When available, the CERT-VU and Link are reported.
* Added the support to SCIP database effort from folks at www.scip.ch. The ids and link are reported (thanks to Marc Ruef @mruef for the help)

 - `get_scip` to check for SCIP database ids
 - `get_certvn` to enumerate the CERT-VN ids
 - `get_openvas` to list the OpenVAS Vulnerability scanner scripts. It always classy to have both Nessus and OpenVAS scripts ;)

 - `get_ubuntu` to list ubuntu patchs
 - `get_gento`. You bet, it's for listing the Gentoo patchs
 - `get_fedora` to list the fedora patchs

* Despite the fact the OSVDB ids was already mapped with vFeed since the beginning, a new method `get_osvdb` has been added to enumerate them when available.
* Added `get_milw0rm` method even if the website is deprecated (for old time's sake)
* Introduced `vfeedcli.py` instead of awful script name `vFeed_Calls_1.py`. From now on,  vFeed CLI should  be used to get CVE attributes
* Slightly modified the `get_cve` keys to (summary, published and modified). Check the `vfeedcli.py` code source.
* vFeed XML format slightly modified. It's still easy to read and to parse.

  - checkMSF to check for Metasploit sploits or plugins
  - checkCAPEC to enumerate the CWE associated (and indirectly CVE) CAPEC ids
